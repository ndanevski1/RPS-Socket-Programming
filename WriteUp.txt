We used TCP protocol for this project. This can be seen in the following line of our code:
"sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)" 
since we use socket.SOCK_STREAM instead of socket.SOCK_DGRAM (which is used for UDP protocol). 

Furthermore, we performed the handshake when the client recieves the name of the server player, and vice versa and the following is displayed the user console:

Server handshake confirmation:
"Hi! You're playing against Nikola"

Client handshake confirmation:
"Hi! You are connected to the server. You are playing against Usama!"

Client sends the name of the player in the connection request and the server responds with the player name of its side and these messages are then printed out.
